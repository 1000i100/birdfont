with a -dev or -devel affix. 

Install the following packages:
valac
libglib2.0-dev 
libgtk2.0-dev 
libxml2-dev 
libwebkitgtk-dev

sudo ./birdfont_install

BirdFont have two build systems one very simple python script that
builds all binaries at once and a better build system based on doit
(pydoit.org). The doit scripts will only rebuild the parts that has 
changed and is the prefered way to compile BirdFont if you are working 
on a new feature.
