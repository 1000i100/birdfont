Building Supplement from source
-------------------------------

Install vala and all required libraries, they are most likely in packages with a 
-dev or -devel affix. You can run this as root if you are using Debian:

apt-get install valac libglib-2.0-dev libgtk+2.0-dev libxml2-dev

Configure, build and install with waf:
./waf configure
./waf build
su
./waf install

You need to install a sensible browser with support for svg-fonts like 
chromium or epiphany if you want to view your font.
